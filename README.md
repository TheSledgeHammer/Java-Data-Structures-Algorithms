# Java-Data-Structures-Algorithms
The following Contains various helpful data structure classes.

Included Data Structures:

Lists:

SinglyLinkedList

DoublyLinkedList

CircularDoublyLinkedList

Maps:

CircularDoublyLinkedMap: A Map implementation of a CircularDoublyLinkedList. Near exactly same as CircularDoublyLinkedList but with a key-value pair.

Trees:

BinaryTree

TernaryTree

BinaryIndexedTree (Aka Fenwick Tree):

Trie: Work in Progress

HashList: Same as a list, but uses a Hash Constant to determine the index of the value stored. Backed by a DoublyLinkedList: Work in Progress: No delete function

HashTableOA: Open Addressing based HashTable: Work in Progress

HashTableSC: Seperate Chaining base HashTable: Work in Progress

Algorithms:

FibonacciHeap: Work in Progress

QuasiGroupGenerator: Can create QuasiGroups of size n with an order of magnitute n, to form a Latin Square.

DammAlgorithm: Can calculate a check digit using Damm's Algorithm. Requires the QuasiGroupGenerator. Work in Progress: Validation using Damm's Algorithm does not work, as the QuasiGroups are randomly generated.
